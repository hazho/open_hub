OpenHub is an Open Source ecosystem management digital tool, committed to help tracking startups, founders, activities and resources in a local startup ecosystem for ecosystem developers. It is written in PHP, is customizable, supports all basic services needs, multilingual and localizable, has a fully responsive design (both front and back office), etc.

Originally developed by [Malaysian Global Innovation & Creativity Centre](https://www.mymagic.my) internal Tech team to power [MaGIC Central](https://central.mymagic.my), the team decided to open source OpenHub to help more local ecosystems accelerate growth.
